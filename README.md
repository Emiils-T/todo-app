## Overview
This version of the to-do application expands upon the basic version by introducing React Router for navigation and JSON-Server for simulating a backend. This allows for a more comprehensive development experience, including the ability to view task details on separate pages.

## Application Features
- List View: Display all tasks in a list, offering an overview and easy access to edit, delete, or mark tasks as completed directly from the list.
- Full Task View: Open tasks in a new page to view details, enhancing user experience.
- Add Task: Users can create tasks with titles and content.
- Edit Task: Existing tasks can be edited.
- Delete Task: Unwanted tasks can be removed.
- Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked off as completed.
- Add Commentary: Allows for adding comments to tasks.
- Edit Commentary: Comments can be edited.
- Delete Commentary: Comments can be deleted.
## Technical Requirements
- Use Components: Structure the application using React components to ensure code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
- JSON-Server: Simulates a backend to work with real data without backend development.
- React Router: Manages navigation within the app, enabling page transitions without reloading.
- UI Libraries: Incorporate any UI library like Ant Design (AntD), shadcn, Material-UI (MUI), or TailwindCSS.

## Līdz 26.08 nepieciešams:
- Pievienot jebkuru UI bibliotēku (AntD, Bootstrap, Bulma, Shadcn, utt.) un izmantot tajā piedāvātās komponentes (Ja tas nav vēl izdarīts).
- Migrēt no React Router uz Tanstack Router.
- Veikt visus API pieprasījumus izmantojot Tanstack Query.
- Sakārtot visu atbilstošās mapītēs (components, utt.).
- Pievienojam react-tostify (vai izmantojam jau pieejamo risinājumu iekš izvēlētās UI bibliotēkas)
